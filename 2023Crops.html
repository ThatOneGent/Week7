<h1>2023 List of Crops</h1>
    
<p>After much debate, planning, and taste testing... the plan going forward is to limit variety. Focusing mostly on what we truely enjoyed.</p> 

<p>Which means...</p>
<h4>TINY THINGS!</h4>

<p>We loved just about everything we planted last year that was tiny in size and stature. Because all of it was <b>BIG ON TASTE</b></p>

        <tr>
            <td>Great White Tomato</td>
            <td>Large Tomato that is fleshy but sweet</td>
            <td>Grow at least one every year, they can get over a lb per fruit.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Spoon Tomato</td>
            <td>A very small tomato that grows in small groupings</td>
            <td>Huge hit. Only did one plant, will likely do multiple this year.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cucamelon</td>
            <td>Mexican sour cucumber. Looks like a tiny little watermelon. Grows on a vine.</td>
            <td>Another huge hit. Ate them off the vine whiel gardening for a quick snack.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chocolate Habanero</td>
            <td>Higher Scoville count than regular Habanero. Smokey flavor.</td>
            <td>A must each year. My favorite type of hot pepper. Perfect in chili to give it a smokey rich heat.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>White Currant Tomato</td>
            <td>Grape tomato that grow multiple on small vines. Lower in acid.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Jelly Melon</td>
            <td>Fruit grows on vines. Turns deep orange when ripe, and has small spiny "horns" on it. Pump inside looks like Lime Jello</td>
            <td>A new addition this year. Something weird to try and give away to folks to also try.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Strawberries</td>
            <td>Strawberries are strawberries...</td>
            <td>Good success with a small basket planet in the greenhouse. Did not create large amounts of fruit, probably need more plants.</td>
